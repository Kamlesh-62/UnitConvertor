# Unit Converter Project

This project was all about diving into Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, getting a feel for how powerful Composable functions are. 

I learned how to integrate state into the app and make it work smoothly. Plus, I got to build a slick, good-looking UI and saw how fast it updates when the state changesâ€”pretty cool stuff!
